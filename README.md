# Reaction Time
This app helps you test your reaction time. The purpose of the app was to check reaction times especially for mouse clicks during gaming.

I had used other reaction time testing apps before and know my average so added a margin of error that seemed more fair to my previous average results and the machine this app was developed on. You can change the margin of error at the bottom of the app to reflect your average results.

## Installation Guide
- `npm install`

## Running Guide
- `npm run start`
- Go to http://localhost:3000/ after running the script
