This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Reaction Time
This app helps you record your reaction time which can be very useful in a lot of ways. The purpose of the app was to mainly check reaction times especially for gaming.

I had used other apps before and know my average so added a margin of error that seemed more fair to my previous results and the machine this app was developed on. You can change the margin of error at the bottom of the app to reflect your average results.
